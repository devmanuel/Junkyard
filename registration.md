Registration
============

The registration for FSTTCS 2020 is open now. We have two categories of registrations: Premium registration and basic registration. There is no difference between a premium registration and a basic registration in terms of entitlements. At least one author per paper has to register in the premium category; other authors can register in the basic category. We request participants to register in the premium category if it is affordable.
